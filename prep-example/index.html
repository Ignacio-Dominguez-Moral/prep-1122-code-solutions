    <!-- write your app ideas here ðŸ‘‡ -->
    With my new coding skills I would like to work closely with
games that have a competitive ranked system in order to incorporate
a ranked tracker directly on the specific games website. This would
eliminate the need for third party websites to track rank which are
often times delayed or in some way inaccurate.
